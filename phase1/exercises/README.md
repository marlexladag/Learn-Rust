# Phase 1 Exercises

Practice what you've learned with these exercises!

## How to Use

Each exercise has:
- A `README.md` with the problem description
- `src/main.rs` with starter code (TODO comments show what to implement)
- `solution.rs` with a working solution (don't peek until you try!)

## Exercises

| # | Exercise | Concepts | Difficulty |
|---|----------|----------|------------|
| 1 | [Temperature Converter](01_temperature/) | Functions, math operations, f64 | Easy |
| 2 | [Fibonacci](02_fibonacci/) | Loops, recursion, functions | Medium |
| 3 | [FizzBuzz](03_fizzbuzz/) | Control flow, match, modulo | Easy |

## Running Exercises

```bash
# Navigate to exercise
cd 01_temperature

# Run your code
cargo run

# Check for errors without building
cargo check
```

## Tips

1. **Read the README carefully** - understand what's expected
2. **Start small** - get something working, then improve
3. **Use `cargo check`** - faster than full compile
4. **Print debug info** - use `println!` to see values
5. **Check the solution** - but only after trying!

## Grading Yourself

- **Complete**: All functions work correctly
- **Partial**: Some functions work, others need fixing
- **Stuck**: Check hints in README, then solution

Good luck! 🦀
